10000-maniacs	More Than This	"I could feel at the time. There was no way of knowing. Fallen leaves in the night. Who can say where they're blowing. As free as the wind. Hopefully learning.

There was no way of knowing. Like a dream in the night. Who can say where we're going. No care in the world. Maybe I'm learning. Why the sea on the tide. Has no way of turning. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. You know there's nothing. More than this. Tell me one thing. More than this. There's nothing."

10000-maniacs	Anthem For Doomed Youth	"For whom do the bells toll. When sentenced to die. The stuttering rifles. Will stifle the cry. The monstrous anger. The fear's rapid rattle. A desert inferno. Kids dying like cattle. Don't tell me. We're not prepared. I've seen today's marine. He's eighteen and he's eager. He can be quite mean. No mock'ries for them. No prayers or bells. The demented choirs. The wailing of shells. The boys holding candles. On untraveled roads. The fear spreads like fire. As shrapnel explodes. I think it's wrong. To conscript our youth. Against their will. When plenty of our citizenry. Really like to kill. What sign posts will lead. To armageddon's fires. What bugles will call them. From crowded grey shires. The women sit quiet. With death on their minds. A slow dusk descending. The drawing of blinds. Make the hunters all line up. It's their idea of fun. And let those be forgiven. Who never owned a gun. Was it him or me. Or the wailing of the dead. The laughing soldiers. Cast their lots. And you can cut the dread."

For all that never happens and all that never will be	. a candle burning for the love we seldom keep.. The earth was raw in her fingers	. she overturned it.. Considered planting some flowers	. they wouldn't last long	. no one to tend them.. It's funny how these things go	. you were the answer to all the questions.. The memories made her weary	. she shuddered slowly	. she didn't want to.. As a distant summer he began to whisper	. and threw a smile her way.. She looked into the glass	. liquid surface showing that they were melding	. together present past.. So where can I go from here?. The color fading	. he didn't answer.. She felt him slip from her vision.. She tried to hold him	 hold on forever.. So close forever	. in a silent frozen sleep.."

10000-maniacs	Gold Rush Brides	"[ Spoken intro from: Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey (by Lillian Schlissel) ]. While the young folks were having their good times. some of the mothers were giving birth to their babies.. Three babies were born in our company that summer..

'til noon when a stop was made and another child was born,. this time Susan Mollmeyer.. And gave the baby the name Alice Nevada.. Follow the typical signs, the hand-painted lines, down prairie roads.. Pass the lone church spire.. Pass the talking wire from where to who knows?. There's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains.. Where a man could drift, in legendary myth, by roaming over spaces.. The land was free and the price was right.. Dakota on the wall is a white-robed woman, broad yet maidenly.. Such power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family.. I see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history.. Who were the homestead wives?. Who were the gold rush brides?. Does anybody know?. Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote?. The land was free, yet it cost their lives.. In miner's lust for gold, a family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece.. A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully.. In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters. they would moan as they would read accounts of. madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief.."

10000-maniacs	Anthem For Doomed Youth	"For whom do the bells toll. When sentenced to die. The stuttering rifles. Will stifle the cry. The monstrous anger. The fear's rapid rattle. A desert inferno. Kids dying like cattle. Don't tell me. We're not prepared. I've seen today's marine. He's eighteen and he's eager. He can be quite mean. No mock'ries for them. No prayers or bells. The demented choirs. The wailing of shells. The boys holding candles. On untraveled roads. The fear spreads like fire. As shrapnel explodes. I think it's wrong. To conscript our youth. Against their will. When plenty of our citizenry. Really like to kill. What sign posts will lead. To armageddon's fires. What bugles will call them. From crowded grey shires. The women sit quiet. With death on their minds. A slow dusk descending. The drawing of blinds. Make the hunters all line up. It's their idea of fun. And let those be forgiven. Who never owned a gun. Was it him or me. Or the wailing of the dead. The laughing soldiers. Cast their lots. And you can cut the dread."

10000-maniacs	Bread And Circuses	"[ Billy Bragg and Natalie Merchant ]. . Crowds gather round kneeling at the feet of common thieves. Hungry for the word, but God would never speak through such as these,. such as these. who offer healing hands and balms, and redemption, a few would cross. their palms. They'll tell your troubles to the Lord for how ever much you can afford. Hands holding hands in the circle of the sinners and the saints. Memories that linger from the cradle, placing puzzles in the grave,. in the grave. No mortal skin and bone can live on bread and circuses alone. The spirit needs, must drive the mystery of why you're alive. CHORUS:. They look and their Book and they read. But their cold hearts say, Follow me. Dance in the dust in the frenzy of the desperately in need. Led by the voices of the men who invoke ritual to hide their greed,. hide their greed. Come every tongue, every eye across the crumbling earth and cracking skies. The gates of hell stand open wide, but the path of glory you walk single. file. (Chorus). These men make a cage for the very souls that came here to be free. They turn off their lights for their tents they're fixing to leave. (Instrumental). Follow me. (Chorus 2x). They'll close their Book and leave, but you'll remain still in pain."

Venus rise overwhelmingly beautiful. he sighs the look of love was in her eyes. puts his hand upon her leg. looking closer his lust begins to fade. what a drag the queen did say.. could this be a dream Iâ€™m in? ( Fellini would be proud ). gluttony enfolds the scene. give them one last round 	. shining faces dance away. swinging skirts between the panted legs. kaleidescoping. then shassez in a blink the glasses fly. suddenly joy becomes a fight. there they tossed and turned a sight.."
